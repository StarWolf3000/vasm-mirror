# vasm

This is a git repository clone of the vasm source code.

You can find the original at the [vasm home](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm).

## About

vasm is a portable and retargetable assembler to create linkable objects in various formats or absolute code. Multiple CPU-, syntax and output-modules can be selected.

Many common directives/pseudo-opcodes are supported (depending on the syntax module) as well as CPU-specific extensions.

The assembler supports optimizations (e.g. choosing the shortest possible branch instruction or addressing mode) and relaxations (e.g. converting a branch to an absolute jump when necessary).

Most syntax modules support macros, include directives, repetitions, conditional assembly and local symbols.



## Compilation Instructions

To compile vasm you can either use CMake, or choose a Makefile which fits for your host architecture.

The following Makefiles are available:

* Makefile - standard Unix/gcc Makefile
* Makefile.68k - makes AmigaOS 68020 executable with vbcc
* Makefile.Haiku - gcc Makefile which doesn't link libm
* Makefile.MiNT - makes Atari MiNT 68020 executable with vbcc
* Makefile.MOS - makes MorphOS executable with vbcc
* Makefile.OS4 - makes AmigaOS4 executable with vbcc
* Makefile.PUp - makes PowerUp executable with vbcc
* Makefile.TOS - makes Atari TOS 68000 executable with vbcc
* Makefile.WOS - makes WarpOS executable with vbcc
* Makefile.Win32 - makes Windows executable with MS-VSC++
* Makefile.Win32FromLinux - makes Windows executable on Linux

Then select a CPU- and a syntax-module to compile.

The vasm-binary will be called: `vasm<CPU>_<SYNTAX>[_<HOST>]`

### Building using CMake

Define `VASM_CPU` and `VASM_SYNTAX` when running cmake, e.g:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DVASM_CPU=m68k -DVASM_SYNTAX=mot ..
make
```

### Building using make

Define `CPU` and `SYNTAX` when running make, e.g:

```bash
make CPU=m68k SYNTAX=mot
```
