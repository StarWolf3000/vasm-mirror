@section General

    This output module outputs the contents of all sections as
    wozmon monitor commands, which is a simple ASCII output of
    hexidecimal digits.

    The output is suitable for an ascii transfer via serial
    connection to a system running wozmon. Character and/or
    line delays are likely to be necessary for a successful
    transfer.

    The wozmon command parser converts up to sixteen bit
    hexidecimal values. An error containing the maximum
    out of range address is reported if a sixteen bit address
    space is exceeded.
